# used_cars_project

This project compares three different maching learning regression models (Linear, KNN, and Random Forest) to predict the price of a used car. The project, and 5 data files are all uploaded. 

The data was pulled from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes)

This project was intended to provide me with practice in data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques. 

Libraries used include: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and SKLearn

In the future, as I learn more about the advancements in machine learning, I hope to use this project as practice in improving and evaluating regression models.
